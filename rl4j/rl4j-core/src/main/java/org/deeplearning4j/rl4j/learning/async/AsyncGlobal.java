/**
 * @author rubenfiszel (ruben.fiszel@epfl.ch) on 8/5/16.
 * <p>
 * In the original paper, the authors uses Asynchronous
 * Gradient Descent: Hogwild! It is a way to apply gradients
 * and modify a model in a lock-free manner.
 * <p>
 * As a way to implement this with dl4j, it is unfortunately
 * necessary at the time of writing to apply the gradient
 * (update the parameters) on a single separate global thread.
 * <p>
 * This Central thread for Asynchronous Method of reinforcement learning
 * enqueue the gradients coming from the different threads and update its
 * model and target. Those neurals nets are then synced by the other threads.
 * <p>
 * The benefits of this thread is that the updater is "shared" between all thread
 * we have a single updater which is the single updater of the model contained here
 * <p>
 * This is similar to RMSProp with shared g and momentum
 * <p>
 * When Hogwild! is implemented, this could be replaced by a simple data
 * structure
